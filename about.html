                    Hi! My name is Miloš Marinković, and I'm a bachelor student at The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Applied Studies in Belgrade. I'm currently writing my final term paper. I've started learning about web development in my final, 3rd year of my studies, and immediatelly knew that this is the carreer path for me. I've had little experience in the field, but I'm constantly learning, and always eager for more.

                <p>
                    I spent 9 months as an intern frontend developer working for CodeIT, a Belgrade digital agency, where I learned basics in responsive web design, communication with clients, and making estimate assumptions about project completion time. I used tools like Slack, Jira and Trello for project management during my internship. During that time, I made a couple of landing pages for numerous clients, created two custom CMS applications, and worked on optimising responsivness of existing projects.
